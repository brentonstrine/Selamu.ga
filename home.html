         <h3> A short deveper's story </h3>
<ol>
<li><p> During my childhood I didn't have access to Computer.</p></li>
<li><p> I started using computer when I joined University because there was one common course (Introduction to
computer and its application).</p></li>
<li><p> After graduation I got a job in the office with a computer access and most of the office tasks had been accomplished by using computers.</p></li>
<li><p> And I got a short term training opportunities on different computer applications like microsoft offices (word, excel, powerpoint, email conversation, . . .etc) and photoshop software.</p></li>
 <li><p> Finally, I tried all my best to practices and improve my knowledge on how to use computer.</p></li>
