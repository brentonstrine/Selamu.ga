          <p class="paragraphmystory"> Regarding my childhood experiences, I didnâ€™t have access to computer in my early ages however I got the opportunity
  to learn the basics and use computer for the first time when I joined University because there was one course entitled as
  <span class="highlight">"Introduction to computer and its application"</span>.<br>
  After graduating from University, I got a job in an office environment with a sufficient access to computer where most of
  the office tasks have been accomplished by using computers. This office was my best place to learn computer through the
  process of daily office tasks and short term trainings. I got a training opportunities on different computer related like <span class="highlight">Microsoft offices (word, excel, PowerPoint) & Photoshop
  software</span> and other technical a
  reas of existing projects.<br>
  After coming to USA, a little bit I was in a dilemma on the selection of future career matching to the new environment and
  system. I tried to get advice from some friends and look at Google, then I decide to study & upgrade my skill in IT areas
  especially like website development, data bases, etc. While I was thinking on how and where to start the basics of coding,

  I got a short term training opportunity about website development using <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS & javascript</span> by professional staff
  Mr. Brenton Strine which is organized by Refugee Career Hub.<br>
